# Configure the Python Path

This extension depends on a version of Python that is 3.9 or higher being
installed. If you don't have Python installed, please do that and then install
the [`aac`](https://pypi.org/project/aac/) tool from PyPI.

If you need help installing Python, check out the instructions on installing it
for your operating system [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
