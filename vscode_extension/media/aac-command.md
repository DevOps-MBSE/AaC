# Execute an AaC command

To make sure everything is set up correctly, go ahead and try executing your
first AaC command from the extension.

If you don't know what to run first, try running one of the commands that don't
require any arguments like:

- `version`: Print the AaC package version.
- `print-spec`: Print the AaC model describing core AaC data types and
  enumerations.
- `print-active-context`: Print the AaC active language context including data
  types and enumerations added by plugins.
