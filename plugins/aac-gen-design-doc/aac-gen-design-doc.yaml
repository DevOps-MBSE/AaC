model:
  name: aac-gen-design-doc
  description: aac-gen-design-doc is an Architecture-as-Code plugin that generates a System Design Document from Architecture-as-Code models.
  behavior:
    - name: gen-design-doc
      type: command
      description: Generate a System Design Document from Architecture-as-Code models.
      input:
        - name: architecture_files
          type: string[]
          description: The yaml files containing the modelled system for which to generate the System Design document.
        - name: output_directory

          description: The directory to which the System Design document will be written.
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Output a System Design document containing an outline of the model and its components.
          given:
            - The {{gen-design-doc.input.architecture_files}} represent a valid system architecture.
          when:
            - The aac application is run with the gen-design-doc command and one, or more, valid architecture files.
          then:
            - A System Design document is written to {{gen-protobuf.input.output_directory}}.
            - The System Design document contains an outline based on the structure of the given model.
        - scenario: Output a System Design document containing use cases and their descriptions.
          given:
            - The {{gen-design-doc.input.architecture_files}} represent a valid system architecture.
          when:
            - The aac application is run with the gen-design-doc command and one, or more, valid architecture files.
          then:
            - A System Design document is written to {{gen-protobuf.input.output_directory}}.
            - The System Design document contains a headers with use cases names.
            - The System Design document contains content with use cases descriptions under the headers.
