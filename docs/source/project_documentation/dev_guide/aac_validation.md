# What is Validation in the AaC Language?
Because the AaC DSL is leveraging plain-text YAML as the underpinning of the DSL, there is little to no functionality to guide users in the correctness of their YAML AaC structures. AaC has implemented a self-validating language feature so that users can reference which rules are applied to which AaC DSL components, and so that users can define validation for their own user-defined structures. To this end, AaC employs a plugin-based validator system where plugins provide Python-based validator implementations that can be referenced and applied to definitions in the AaC DSL.

Validation rules in AaC are defined with the `validation` definition, which are required to have a corresponding implementation, called a validator plugin. This enables AaC's self-validating mechanism even though YAML is just a markup language.

## Validating the AaC Language
The overall validation mechanism follows this flow:
1. A definition is identified as needing to be validated
2. The definition is parsed for any nested AaC structures
  a. For example, fields in `schema.fields` will trigger the `Field` schema's validation rules.
3. For all of identified AaC structures, each is checked for any `validation` entries
4. For each `validation` entry -- the corresponding `schema` for the substructure and the definition being validated are passed to the corresponding validator plugin
  a. Every instance of `Field` in our example `schema` definition is validated against the rule `Type references exist`
5. Once all of the components of the definition with validation rules are validated, any violations are reported as validation errors.
6. All validation errors from all of the validation rules are collected and returned together
  a. If there are no errors, the definition successfully validates
  b. If there are errors, the definition fails validation

## Validation Definitions
In order for users to document the self-validating constraints in the AaC DSL, they have to declare validation rules via `validation` definitions. These definitions also provide contextual information for the validation as well as behaviors and acceptance criteria -- something to leverage for automatically generating functional/integration tests in the future.


Here is an example `validation` definition:

exclusive_fields.yaml
```yaml
validation:
  name: Mutually exclusive fields
  description: |
    Verify that only one of the fields are defined at any time.
    Exclusive fields are defined by declaring the exclusive field names as validation arguments.
  behavior:
    - name: Verify mutually exclusive fields
      type: request-response
      description:
      input:
        - name: input
          type: ValidatorInput
      output:
        - name: results
          type: ValidatorOutput
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Successfully validate one exclusive field
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definitions with only one of the mutually exclusive fields defined.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any errors
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any warnings
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the validator plugin under test is valid
        - scenario: Successfully validate zero exclusive fields
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definitions with none of the mutually exclusive fields defined.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any errors
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any warnings
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the validator plugin under test is valid
        - scenario: Fail to validate multiple exclusive fields
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of otherwise valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definitions with more than one of the mutually exclusive fields defined.
          when:
            - The ValidatorInput is validated
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput has errors
            - The ValidatorOutput errors indicate that mutually exclusive fields are simultaneously defined.
```

Each `validation` definition is required to have a corresponding a Python implementation, which can be seen as a valdiation rule in the `Validation` schema definition:

```yaml
schema:
  name: Validation
  fields:
    - name: name
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the validation rule and plugin.
    - name: description
      type: string
      description: |
        A high-level description of the validation plugin.
    - name: behavior
      type: Behavior[]
      description: |
        A list of behaviors that the validation plugin will perform.
  validation:
    - name: Validation definition has an implementation
    - name: Required fields are present
      arguments:
        - name
        - description
        - behavior
```

## Validator Plugins
Each validator plugin provides its validation function to the core package via pluggy hooks. Each validator plugin should provide one validation function with the following signature:
```python
def validate_example(definition_under_test: Definition, target_schema_definition: Definition, language_context: LanguageContext, *validation_args) -> ValidatorResult:
    """
    Validates that the none of the fields are simultaneously defined.
    Args:
        definition_under_test (Definition): The definition that's being validated.
        target_schema_definition (Definition): A definition with applicable validation.
        language_context (LanguageContext): The language context.
        *validation_args (list[string]): The list of exclusive fields.
    Returns:
        A ValidatorResult containing any applicable error messages.
    """
```

The internal logic of the function is up to the user, but the plugins generally follow the idea of:
1. Extract all instances of the `target_schema_definition` from the `definition_under_test`
2. For each instance of the target schema, which is represented as a dictionary, apply your validation specific logic
3. If the definition under test doesn't meet the constraints of the validator, register and return an error message
