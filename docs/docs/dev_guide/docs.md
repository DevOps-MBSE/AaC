# AaC Documentation
AaC documentation consists of two groups of generated documents: these jekyll pages and Sphinx API documentation for the Python API.

## Jekyll Docs
Our Jekyll documentation is a collection of manually-maintained README pages. We use the Jekyll documentation to describe user-facing features and developer-facing features (like this page).

### Setup
Generating the Jekyll documentation requires the Ruby build tool [Bundler](https://bundler.io/). To modify these pages, you'll need to have this installed in your local development environment.

If you haven't built the Jekyll docs before, you'll need to run `bundle install` inside the top-level repository directory `docs`. Voila! The links work, and you can create a public link to share with others to see.

### Serving Jekyll Pages in Gitpod
Because Gitpod is a container-based development environment, it presents some peculiarities for users who may be trying to serve Jekyll files. One of the larger issues is that the Jekyll docs use `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` as the base URL while the actual hostname is the Gitpod container's public address.

In order to override the `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` hostname when serving these pages, you'll need to set the environment variable `JEKYLL_ENV` to `production` like so:

`export JEKYLL_ENV=production`

Once Jekyll is in production mode, you'll need to override the `url` config value in `_config.yml` to be `https://4000-<gitpod instance URL>` (e.g. `https://4000-jondavidblack-aac-70of4eyyt7j.ws-us70.gitpod.io`)

Then just serve the pages by running `bundle exec jekyll s` or `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Sphinx API Documentation
We use the automated documentation generation tool, [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), for generating API documentation for the AaC Python package.

### Writing API Documentation

Regarding documentation, some guidelines for this project are as follows:

1. Write meaningful docstrings for all public API (i.e. public classes, functions, etc.);
   - Private functions are distinguished by the preceding `_` so, where a public function would be written `public_function`; a private function would be written as `_private_function`.
1. Write docstrings using the [Google Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings);
1. Spelling matters, as much as possible, make sure your docstrings don't have things misspelled.

### Building the API Documentation

To generate the Sphinx API documentation, run:

```bash
$ cd docs/
$ make html
```

Once you've run the above `make` command, you can view the documentation by opening the `build/html/index.html` file in a web browser, or by doing the following:

```bash
$ cd build/html/
$ python -m http.server 3000
```

After this, you can navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000 to view the documentation.
