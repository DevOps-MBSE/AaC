# Basic Project Structure
AaC is unopinionated about project structures, so they can be very flexible. However, we do suggest storing models in an organized project directory structure, like maintaining all AaC files under a top, or near-top level directory `src/`. An example project might look like:
```
src/system/system.yaml
src/system/external_messages.yaml
src/service_one/service_one.yaml
src/service_one/service_one_misc_definitions.yaml
src/service_two/service_two.yaml
...
```

## Embedding AaC files alongside your implementation
Because AaC can be used to generate code, users may find themselves with a project repository consisting of:
1. AaC files that describe the architecture and drive code-stub generation
2. Version-controlled implementation files that compliments the stubbed/interface code files generated by AaC

There is no requirement to maintain these files in any sort of relationship or directory structure as long as the AaC files can reference each other.
