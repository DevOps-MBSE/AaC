# Basic Project Structure
AaC is unopinionated about project structures, so they can be very flexible. However, we do suggest storing models in an organized project directory structure, such as maintaining all AaC files under a top, or near-top level directory `src/`. An example project might look like:
```
src/system/system.yaml
src/external/external_interface_messages.yaml
src/external/external_actors.yaml
src/service_one/service_one.yaml
src/service_one/service_one_misc_definitions.yaml
src/service_two/service_two.yaml
...
```

## Anatomy of an AaC file
Since AaC leverages YAML for its DSL, there are very few restrictions on how to store and organize AaC files and AaC definitions. The main consideration is that every AaC definition must have be defined in its own YAML document _or_ YAML file.

YAML provides a keyword/symbol `---` to denote a logical document separator for multiple YAML documents within in a YAML file. This means that if we store multiple AaC definitions in the same file, they must be separated using the `---` symbol. If they aren't separated correctly then the AaC file will not be recognized as valid YAML.

These two examples are equivalent and both valid:
_schemas.yaml_
```yaml
schema:
    name: Schema1
    fields:
        - name: integer
          type: int
---
schema:
    name: Schema2
    fields:
        - name: string
          type: string
```

is therefore equivalent to

_schema1.yaml_
```yaml
schema:
    name: Schema1
    fields:
        - name: integer
          type: int
```
_schema2.yaml_
```yaml
schema:
    name: Schema2
    fields:
        - name: string
          type: string
```

## Referencing AaC structures across files
Another consideration when deciding how to organize AaC definitions is which definitions reference each other. If `definition A` references `definition B`, then both definitions will need to be either declared in the same AaC file or `definition A` will need to define imports including the relative path to the file containing `definition B`.

For example, `schemaA` references `schemaB`, but both definitions are in separate files.

_schemaA.yaml_
```yaml
import:
  - ./schemaB.yaml
schema:
    name: schemaA
    fields:
        - name: sub-datastructure
          type: schemaB
        - name: integer
          type: int
```
_schemaB.yaml_
```yaml
schema:
    name: schemaB
    fields:
        - name: string
          type: string
```

## Embedding AaC files alongside your implementation
Because AaC can be used to generate code, users may find themselves with a project repository consisting of:
1. AaC files that describe the architecture and drive code-stub generation
2. Version-controlled implementation files that compliments the stubbed/interface code files generated by AaC

There is no requirement to maintain these files in any sort of relationship or directory structure as long as the AaC files can reference each other.
