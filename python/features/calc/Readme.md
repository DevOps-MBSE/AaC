# Calculator Model

The calculator model is an initial test case for the aac-spec plugin.  The intent is to establish core modeling
ability to define requirement specifications and trace those to an architecture model.  In this instance the
structure of the specification is intentionally different than the structure of the model.  This shows that
the specification structure can still be traces to an architecture model without imposing structure.
