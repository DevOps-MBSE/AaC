usecase:
  name: Nominal flow of data through the system
  description: Something happens.
  participants:
    - user
    - system
  steps:
    - The user invokes doFlow on system
    - The system performs flow and responds to the user

  name: Nominal flow within the system
  description:
  participants:
    - system
    - svc1
    - subsystem

  steps:
    - The system has been invoked to doFlow which triggers scv1
    - svc1 completes and calls subsystem to continue the flow
    - subsystem completes and calls svc3 to continue the flow
    - svc3 completes and provides the result back to system
