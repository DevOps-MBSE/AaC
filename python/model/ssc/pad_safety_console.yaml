        The PSC shall be in a dedicated position to provide the Pad Safety
        Supervisor/Pad Safety Officer sufficient information and communications
        capability to convey safety status and conditions to the appropriate
        authority (e.g., the launch complex control authority for day-to-day
        operations and the Mission Flight Control Officer [MFCO] during a launch
        operation).
    - id: 5.2.2
      shall: |
        The minimum controls, monitors and communication lines required at the
        launch complex PSC. These items are general in nature and may vary

        The monitor circuit shall be designed so that the actual status of the
        critical parameters can be monitored rather than the command
        transmittal. It is important that this console does not have any flight
        termination system (FTS) command transmittal functions.
