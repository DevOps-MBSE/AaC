      acceptance:
        - scenario: Generate a core AaC DSL model from a SysML AaC model.
          given:
            - The {{aac-to-sysml.input.architecture-file}} contains a valid model written in the SysML DSL.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the aac-to-sysml command.
          then:
            - An AaC core DSL model is generated in the output directory.
