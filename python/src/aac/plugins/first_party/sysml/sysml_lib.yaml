    A Conform relationship is a generalization between a view and a viewpoint. The view conforms to the specified rules and
    conventions detailed in the viewpoint. When this is done, the view is said to conform to the viewpoint. Conform extends
    UML generalization.

    Constraints:

  name: SysML.Block
  description: |
    Corresponds to the Block element and abstract syntax reference SysML::Blocks::Block.

    A Block is a modular unit that describes the structure of a system or element. It may include both structural and
    behavioral features, such as properties and operations, that represent the state of the system and behavior that the system
    may exhibit. Some of these properties may hold parts of a system, which can also be described by blocks that type the
    properties. Properties without types do not restrict the instances that can be values of the properties, as if they had the
    most general type possible. A block may include a structure of connectors between its properties to indicate how its parts
    or other properties relate to one another.

    Constraints:
    1. For an association in which both ends are typed by blocks, the number of ends shall be exactly two.
    2. The number of ends of a connector owned by a block shall be exactly two. (In SysML, a binding connector is not typed by
        an association, so this constraint is not implied entirely by the preceding constraint.)
    3. In the UML metamodel on which SysML is built, any instance of the Property metaclass that is typed by a block (a Class
      with the «block» stereotype applied) and which is owned by an Association must [sic] not have a name and may not be
      defined as a navigable owned end of the association. (While the Property has a “name” property as defined by its
      NamedElement superclass, the value of the “name” property, which is optional, must be missing.)
    4. In the UML metamodel on which SysML is built, a Property that is typed by a block must [sic] be defined as an end of an
        association. (An inverse end of this association, whether owned by another block or the association itself, must always be
        present so there is always a metamodel element to record the inverse multiplicity of the reference.)
    5. The following constraint under 9.3.6, “Connector” in the UML 2 standard is removed by SysML: “[3] The
        ConnectableElements attached as roles to each ConnectorEnd owned by a Connector must [sic] be roles of the Classifier
        that owned the Connector, or they must be ports of such roles.”
    6. If a property owned by a SysML Block or SysML ValueType is typed by a SysML ValueType, then the aggregation
        attribute of the property shall be “composite.”
    7. Within an instance of a SysML Block, the values of any property with composite aggregation (aggregation = composite)
        shall not contain the block in any of its own properties that also have composite aggregation, or within any unbroken chain
        of properties that all have composite aggregation. (Within an instance of a SysML Block, the instances of properties with
        composite aggregation shall form an acyclic graph.)
    8. Any classifier that specializes a Block shall also have the Block stereotype or one of its specializations applied.
    9. The following constraint under 9.3.7, “ConnectorEnd” in the UML 2 standard is removed by SysML: “[3] The property
        held in self.partWithPort must [sic] not be a Port.”

    The BoundReference stereotype can be applied to properties that have binding connectors, to highlight their usage as
    constraining other properties. The bound end of the stereotype is a connector end of one of the binding connectors,
    opposite the stereotyped property. The binding path includes the property at the bound end, and before that, the property
    path of the bound end, if it is a nested connector end.

    Constraints
    1. Properties to which BoundReference is applied shall be the role of a connector end of at least one binding connector, or
        generalized by such a property through redefinition.
    2. The value of boundEnd shall be a connector end of a binding connector, as identified in constraint 1, opposite the property,
        as identified in constraint 1.
    3. The role of boundEnd shall be a property accessible by navigation from instances of the block owning the property to
        which BoundReference is applied, but shall not be the property to which BoundReference is applied, or one that it is
        related to by redefinition.
    4. The last value of bindingPath shall be the role of boundEnd, and the other values shall be the propertyPath of the
        NestedConnectorEnd applied to boundEnd, if any.
    5. Properties to which BoundReference is applied shall either be reference properties or value properties.
    6. Properties with BoundReference applied that have an upper multiplicity greater than one shall be ordered and non-unique.
    7. BoundReferences shall not be applied to properties that are related by redefinition to other properties with
      BoundReference applied.

    A Unit is a quantity in terms of which the magnitudes of other quantities that have the same quantity kind can be stated.
    A unit often relies on precise and reproducible ways to measure the unit. For example, a unit of length such as meter may
    be specified as a multiple of a particular wavelength of light. A unit may also specify less stable or precise ways to
    express some value, such as a cost expressed in some currency, or a severity rating measured by a numerical scale.

    Corresponds to the Unit element and abstract syntax reference UML4SysML::InstanceSpecification.

      description: |
        A Unit may be associated to several QuantityKinds. This one-to-many association capability between “measurement
        units” (represented as Units) and “kind-of-quantities” (represented as QuantityKinds) reflects a subtle but important
        distinction that “measurement units of quantities of the same quantity dimension may be designated by the same name and
        symbol even when the quantities are not of the same kind. For example, joule per kelvin and J/K are respectively the name
        and symbol of both a measurement unit of heat capacity and a measurement unit of entropy, which are generally not considered
        to be quantities of the same kind.

  description: |
    A Binding Connector is a connector which specifies that the properties at both ends of the connector have equal values.
    If the properties at the ends of a binding connector are typed by a ValueType, the connector specifies that the instances of
    the properties shall hold equal values, recursively through any nested properties within the connected properties. If the
    properties at the ends of a binding connector are typed by a Block, the connector specifies that the instances of the
    properties shall refer to the same block instance. As with any connector owned by a SysML Block, the ends of a binding
    connector may be nested within a multi-level path of properties accessible from the owning block. The
    NestedConnectorEnd stereotype is used to represent such nested ends just as for nested ends of other SysML connectors.

    Constraints
    1. The two ends of a binding connector shall have either the same type or types that are compatible so that equality of their
        values can be defined.
