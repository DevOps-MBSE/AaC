  name: SysML.ModelElements.ElementGroup
  description: |
    The ElementGroup stereotype provides a lightweight mechanism for grouping various and possibly heterogeneous model
    elements by extending the capability of comments to refer to multiple annotated elements. For example, it can group
    elements that are associated with a particular release of the model, have a certain risk level, or are associated with a
    legacy design. The semantics of ElementGroup is modeler-defined. In particular, the body text is not restricted. It can
    describe the grouped elements as well as elements or values related to the grouped elements.
  fields:
    - name: name
      type: string
      description: The name of the element group

  name: SysML.ModelElements.Problem
  description: |
    A Problem documents a deficiency, limitation, or failure of one or more model elements to satisfy a requirement or need,
    or other undesired outcome. It may be used to capture problems identified during analysis, design, verification, or
    manufacture and associate the problem with the relevant model elements. Problem is a stereotype of comment and may be
    attached to any other model element in the same manner as a comment.

schema:
  name: SysML.ModelElements.Rationale
  description: |
    A Rationale documents the justification for decisions and the requirements, design, and other decisions. A Rationale can
    be attached to any model element including relationships. It allows the user, for example, to specify a rationale that may
    reference more detailed documentation such as a trade study or analysis report. Rationale is a stereotype of comment and
    may be attached to any other model element in the same manner as a comment.

schema:
  name: SysML.ModelElements.View
  description: |
    A View is a model element that represents a real world artifact that can be presented to stakeholders. The view is the
    result of querying one or more models that are defined by a viewpoint method. The view shall conform to the viewpoint
    in terms of the viewpoint stakeholders, concerns, method, language, and presentation requirements.

    Constraints:
      1. A view shall only conform to a single viewpoint.
      2. The derived value of the viewpoint shall be the classifier stereotyped by Viewpoint that is the general classifier of the
          generalization relationship stereotyped by Conform for which the View is the specific classifier.
      3. The derived values of the stakeholder attribute shall be the names of the classifiers stereotyped by Stakeholder that are the
          values of the stakeholder attribute of the general classifier of the generalization relationship stereotyped by Conform for
          which the View is the specific classifier.
  fields:
    - name: viewpoint

      description: The list of stakeholders is derived from the viewpoint the view conforms to.
---
schema:
  name: SysML.ModelElements.ViewPoint
  description: |
    A Viewpoint is a specification of the conventions and rules for constructing and using a view for the purpose of
    addressing a set of stakeholder concerns. They specify the elements expected to be represented in the view, and may be
    formally or informally defined. For example, the security viewpoint may require the security requirements, security
    functional and physical architecture, and security test cases.

    Constraints:
      1. The derived values of the method attribute shall be the names of the methods of the operations stereotyped by the UML. Create stereotype on the classifier stereotyped by Viewpoint.
      2. The property ownedOperation shall include at least one operation named “View” with the UML Create stereotype applied.

schema:
  name: SysML.ModelElements.Conform
  description: |
    A Conform relationship is a generalization between a view and a viewpoint. The view conforms to the specified rules and
    conventions detailed in the viewpoint. When this is done, the view is said to conform to the viewpoint. Conform extends
    UML generalization.

    Constraints:
      1. The general classifier shall be an element stereotyped by Viewpoint.
      2. The specific classifier shall be an element that is stereotyped by View.

  description: |
    The expose relationship relates a view to one or more model elements. Each model element is an access point to initiate
    the query. The view and the model elements related to the view are passed to the constructor when it is invoked. The
    method describes how the exposed elements are navigated to extract the desired information.
