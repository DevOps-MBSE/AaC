    Primitive Type Checking is an Architecture-as-Code plugin that provides
    primitive type validations for the primitive enum types defined in the core specification.
  behavior:
    - name: Validate Integer Primitives
      type: request-response
      description:
      input:
        - name: input
          type: ValidatorInput
      output:
        - name: results
          type: ValidatorOutput
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Successfully Validate an Integer Primitive Value
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions
            - The ValidatorInput contains at least one definition field that is defined as being type `int`
            - The value in the primitive `int` field is a non-string whole number
          when:
            - The input is validated
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any errors
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any warnings
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the primitive value under test is valid
        - scenario: Fail to Validate an Integer Primitive Value is A Float
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions
            - The ValidatorInput contains at least one definition field that is defined as being type `int`
            - The value in the primitive `int` field is a decimal number
          when:
            - The input is validated
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates an error
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the primitive value under test is invalid
        - scenario: Fail to Validate an Integer Primitive Value Is a String
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions
            - The ValidatorInput contains at least one definition field that is defined as being type `int`
            - The value in the primitive `int` field contains alphabetical letters or punctuation marks
          when:
            - The input is validated
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates an error
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the primitive value under test is invalid
