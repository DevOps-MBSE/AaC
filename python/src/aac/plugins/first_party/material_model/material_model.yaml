      acceptance:
        - scenario: Valid deployment is converted to a BOM in CSV format.
          given:
            - The path at {{gen-bom.input.architecture-file}} exists.
            - The path at {{gen-bom.input.architecture-file}} contains a valid architecture specification.
          when:
            - The aac app is run with the gen-bom command.
          then:
            - A message saying BOM generation was successful is printed to the console.
            - A csv file is generated with the generated BOM.
