model:
  name: gen-design-doc
  description: gen-design-doc is an Architecture-as-Code plugin that generates a System Design Document from Architecture-as-Code models.
  behavior:
    - name: gen-design-doc
      type: command
      description: Generate a System Design Document from Architecture-as-Code models.
      input:
        - name: architecture-file
          type: file
          python_type: str
          description: An AaC file containing the modeled system for which to generate the System Design document.
        - name: output-directory
          type: directory
          python_type: str
          description: The directory to which the System Design document will be written.

          type: file
          python_type: str
          description: The name of the Jinja2 template file to use for generating the document. (optional)
      acceptance:
        - scenario: Output a System Design document containing an outline of the model and its components.
          given:
            - The {{gen-design-doc.input.architecture-file}} represents a valid system architecture.
            - The {{gen-design-doc.input.template-file}} exists and is a valid Jinja2 template.
          when:
            - The aac application is run with the gen-design-doc command and a valid architecture file, a template file, and an output directory.
          then:
            - A System Design document is written to {{gen-design-doc.input.output-directory}}.
            - The {{gen-design-doc.input.template-file}} template is used as a basis for the System Design document.
            - The System Design document is generated and contains an outline of the model(s).
