      acceptance:
        - scenario: Successfully validate definition root key.
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definition that has a root key defined by the 'root' definition in the core specification.

            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the definition under test is valid.
        - scenario: Successfully validate an extended root key.
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput content of an extension definition that adds a new root key.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definition that has a root key that has been added to the 'root' definition in the core specification.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.

            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the definition under test is valid.
        - scenario: Fail to validate definitions that reference keys that are not defined by the 'root' definition.
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of otherwise valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains at least one AaC definition that has a root key not defined by the 'root' definition in the core specification.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput has errors.
            - The ValidatorOutput errors indicate that the root key is not defined in the root keys definition.
