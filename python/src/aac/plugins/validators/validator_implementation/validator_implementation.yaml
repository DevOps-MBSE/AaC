        - scenario: Successfully Validate a Validator Plugin
          given:
            - The plugin has a valid `validation` definition.
            - The plugin has a corresponding python implementation of the validator spechook.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is tested
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any errors
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any warnings
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the validator plugin under test is valid
        - scenario: Fail to Validate a Validator Plugin with Missing Python Implementation
          given:
            - The plugin has a valid `validation` definition.
            - The plugin does not have a corresponding python implementation of the validator spechook.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is tested
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput has errors
            - The ValidatorOutput errors indicate that there is no corresponding python implementation
