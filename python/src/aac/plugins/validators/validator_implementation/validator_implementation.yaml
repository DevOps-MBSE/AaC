      acceptance:
        - scenario: Successfully validate a validator plugin.
          given:
            - The validation plugin has a valid `validation` definition.
            - The validation definition has a corresponding python implementation.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any errors.
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any warnings.
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the validator plugin under test is valid.
        - scenario: Fail to validate a validator plugin with missing python implementation.
          given:
            - The validation plugin has a valid `validation` definition.
            - The validation does not have definition has a corresponding python implementation.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput has errors.
            - The ValidatorOutput errors indicate that there is no corresponding python implementation.
