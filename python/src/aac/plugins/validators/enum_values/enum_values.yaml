      acceptance:
        - scenario: Successfully validate enum type.
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definitions that has an enum field.
            - The ValidatorInput enum field value is defined by the enum definition specified as the type for the field.
          when:
            - The validator plugin is executed.
          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any errors.
            - The ValidatorOutput does not indicate any warnings.
            - The ValidatorOutput indicates the definition under test is valid.
        - scenario: Fail to validate enum type.
          given:
            - The ValidatorInput content consists of otherwise valid AaC definitions.
            - The ValidatorInput contains some AaC definitions that has an enum field.
            - The ValidatorInput enum field value is not defined by the enum definition specified as the type for the field.
          when:

          then:
            - The ValidatorOutput has errors.
            - The ValidatorOutput errors indicate that the enum value present is not defined as a value in the field's type-defining enum.
