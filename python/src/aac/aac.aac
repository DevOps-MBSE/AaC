  python_type: Any
  description:  |
    A catch-all primitive type that will accept any value.  It is recommended to avoid the use
    of any as it can make it difficult to reason about your model.

    Due to the broad applicability of the any primitive, it is not possible to provide a general
    purpose constraint checker. If you find a need to use the any primitive, we recommend
    defining a custom constraint to check the value for your usage.

  python_type: str
  description:  |
    A reference to another defined data item.  References are qualified and documented
    as 'reference(schema_root.field_name)' denoting the definition and field being referenced.

    Do not confuse data references with type references.  A data reference can be thought of as
    a pointer to a specific data item, while a type reference is a pointer to a definition.  Data
    references do not comprehend type inheritance or polymorphism.
  constraints:
    - name: Check dataref
---
primitive:
  name: typeref
  package: aac.lang
  python_type: str
  description:  |
    A reference to another defined type.  Reference types are typed and documented
    as 'typeref(package_name.type_name)' denoting the package and type being referenced.
    A typeref respects inheritance and will respect references using polymorphism.  For example,
    you can reference primitive type, enums, and schemas by using the typeref 'typeref(aac.lang.AacType)'.
    Because Primitive, Enum, and Schema all extend from AacType, any value provided for these
    types will be accepted by the typeref.
