    by running the 'aac check' command against your model.
  fields:
    - name: name
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the schema constraint rule.
    - name: description
      type: string
      description: |
        A high level description of the schema constraint rule.
    - name: acceptance
      type: Feature[]
      description: |
        A list of acceptance test features that describe the expected behavior of the schema constraint.
  constraints:
    - name: Required fields are present
      arguments:
        - name
        - description

schema:
  name: PrimitiveConstraint
  description: |
    The definition of a primitive constraint plugin.  Plugin constraints perform
    checks against individual values within a model based on it's primitive definition.
    Defining a primitive constraint allows for automted value quality checks
    by running the 'aac check' command against your model.

      description: |
        A reference to the relevant primitive type.
    - name: acceptance

      description: |
        A list of acceptance test features that describe the expected behavior of the primitive constraint.
