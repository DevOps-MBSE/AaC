    - name: enum
      type: enum
      description: |
        A definition that represents an enumerated type of value.

        An example of when to use an 'enum' is when you want to provide several
        different options for a single value.
    - name: schema
      type: schema
      description: |
        A definition that defines the schema/structure of definitions.

        An example use of Map would be to declare a key-value data structure
        with keys of type A and values of type B.
    - name: model
      type: model
      description: |
        A definition that represents a system and/or component model.

        behavior for some component of the system.
    - name: usecase
      type: usecase
      description: |
        A definition that represents a usecase for the system.

    - name: ext
      type: extension
      description: |
        A meta definition used for adding information to another definition.

        An example of when to use an 'ext' is when you wish to add extra
        information to a model that isn't included in the core specification or
        the specification of any plugins you may have installed.

        You can extend any 'enum' and 'schema' definition.
    - name: plugin
      type: Plugin
      description: |
        A reference to a plugin. Plugins can provide any extra functionality
        desired on top of AaC-modeled systems from document generation to code
        generation and everything in between.

        Plugins are referenced by name.
    - name: validation
      type: Validation
      description: |
        A reference to a validation plugin. Validation plugins provide
        verification and validation for the definition to which they are
        attached and any uses of that definition, depending on the validation
        plugins referenced by it.

        Validators are referenced by name.
