    WARNING: This makes changes to the user's file system - be sure you know what you're doing, you
    want to do this, and you're only removing generated files.

    It's sometimes useful to make sure a directory is empty before running tests so as to ensure (e.g.) file generation is
    working consistently and correctly. This utility assists in achieving that.

    Arguments:
        dirspec (str): The absolute directory path whose contents will be removed.
        file_list (str): A list of files to be removed from dirspec. If not provided, all files are removed. (optional)
