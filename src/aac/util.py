"""Arch-as-Code helper utilities to simplify development.

The aac.util module provides some functionality discovered to be valuable
during the development of aac.  By placing this behavior in a utility
module we prevent code duplication and simplify maintenance.

Avoid adding to this module, always look for ways move these functions into modules with similar functionality.

def search(model: dict[str, Any], search_keys: list[str]) -> list:
    """
    Search an AaC model structure by key(s).

    Searches a dict for the contents given a set of keys. Search returns a list of
    the entries in the model that correspond to those keys.  This search will
    traverse the full dict tree, including embedded lists.

        Typical usage example:
        Let's say you have a dict structure parsed from the following AaC yaml.

            data:
            name: MyData
            fields:
                - name: one
                type: string
                - name: two
                type: string
            required:
                - one

        You know the structure of the specification and need to iterate through each field.
        The search utility method simplifies that for you.

            for field in util.search(my_model, ["data", "fields"]):
                print(f"field_name: {field["name"]} field_type {field["type"]}")

        The above example demonstrates a complex type being returned as a dict.  Search will also
        provide direct access to simple types in the model.

            for field_name in util.search(my_model, ["data", "fields", "name"]):
                print(f"field_name: {field_name}")

    Args:
        model: The model to search.  This is often the value taken from the dict returned
            by aac.parser.parse(<aac_file>).
        search_keys: A list of strings representing keys in the model dict hierarchy.

    Returns:
        Returns a list of found data items based on the search keys.
