    - name: enum
      type: enum
      description: |
        A definition that represents an enumerated type of value.

        An example of when to use an 'enum' is when you want to provide several
        different options for a single value.
    - name: data
      type: data
      description: |
        A definition that represents a data value.

        A 'data' definition can generally be thought of as shorthand for 'data
        structure'.

      type: model
      description: |
        A definition that represents a system and/or component model.

        behavior for some component of the system.
    - name: usecase
      type: usecase
      description: |
        A definition that represents a usecase for the system.

        An example of when to use a 'usecase' is when you want to define how the
        system might be used in a particular instance.
    - name: ext
      type: extension
      description: |
        A meta definition used for adding information to another definition.

        An example of when to use an 'ext' is when you wish to add extra
        information to a model that isn't included in the core specification or
        the specification of any plugins you may have installed.

        You can extend any 'enum' and 'data' definition.
